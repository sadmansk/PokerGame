PokerGame
=========

As I was working on a poker game as the summative for my grade 11 computer science class, I was in charge of the back end of the program. I developed fairly complex algorithms that could check and categorize the poker rank of the different hands in the game. I later wrote a program to test my algorithms on each of the rank checkers by checking one billion different hands and comparing the probability with the theoretical probability of each hand, the results proved my algorithm to be accurate.
